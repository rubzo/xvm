l X - load integer X onto top of stack
s X - load character X onto top of stack
S X - concatenate character X onto string on top of stack

r X - read the value in variable named 'X' onto the top of the stack
w X - write the value on the top of the stack into variable named 'X'
      (also remove this value from the stack)

i   - read an integer from the console, store on top of stack
p   - print string or value on top of stack to console, removing it


d   - put a duplicate of the value on top of the stack...on top of stack
+   - remove two values from the top of the stack, add them together,
      put result on top of stack
-   - remove two values from the top of the stack, subtract them,
      put result on top of stack
*   - remove two values from the top of the stack, multiply them,
      put result on top of stack

b X - jump to instruction that is X instructions after this instruction
      (X can be in hex, so from 1 to e (15))
B X - jump to instruction that is X instructions BEFORE this instruction

e   - compare two values on top of stack, remember if equal
E   - compare two values on top of stack, remember if not equal

c X - if previously tested condition was true, do as 'b' instruction
C X - if previously tested condition was true, do as 'C' instruction
